## Testing Data
To evaluate the storyboard creation performance for stories in the wild, we collect 200 stories from three different sources including Chinese idioms, movie scripts and sentences in the GraphMovie plot explanations, which contain 579 sentences in total. For each sentence, we manually annotate its relevancy with the top candidate images from the text-based retrieval.
